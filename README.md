# Redux Road
A simple program to practice basic Redux.

## Topics Covered
- Reducers
    - How they must follow the rule of being immutable and having a pure function.
    - Use switch cases to create different scenarios for corresponding actions.
    - Using the spread operator to keep the reducer true to it's rules.

- Actions
    - Created different action objects with every call to the reducer.
    - Want to see how actions can be used by storing them in variables for repeated use.

- State
    - Updating the applications state based off of an action that the player chooses

## Further Plans
I want to take this to a more interactive level that incorporates event handlers similar to the Oregon Trail game.
